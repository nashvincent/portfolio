Pathfinding algorithms are algorithms that attempt to find generally the **shortest path** between a starting point and an ending point. They are extremely important and have a wide range of applications such as IP routing, logistics planning and in video games.

Some popular pathfinding algorithms are:

- Dijkstra's Shortest Path First Algorithm
- A\* Search Algorithm
- Depth First Search
- Best First Search

Pathfinding is closely related to the shortest path problem, within **graph theory**, which examines how to identify the path that best meets some criteria (**shortest, cheapest, fastest, etc**) between two points in a large network.

Since its is such a abstract and complex topic, I built [a tool to visualize these algorithms](https://nashvincent.github.io/pathfinding-algorithm-visualizer/) in action to help not only me, but also everyone else in solidifying their understanding of these algorithms.
