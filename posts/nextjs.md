**Next.js** is a framework built on top of React in order to aid the developer experience and enable us to "hit the ground running", so to speak. In my opinion, Next.js **_completes_** React by adding some essential features such as:

- Pre-rendering
- File-based Routing
- Code splitting
- Typescript Support
- Static Exports

Next.js gives you the best developer experience with all the features you need for production with **zero config**, out of the box.

Next.js abstracts out all of the **performance optimizations** that we would otherwise have to make when writing plain 'ol React apps. Next.js also extracts the javascript code that is shared across a lot of the components to speed up the app.

Another important feature which makes Next.js stand out is its capability for **better SEO**. Since we have the option of doing server-side rendering, the page can be requested, crawled and indexed immediately.
